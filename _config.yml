# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  bio    : "Dan Biwott builds machine learning systems at the bleeding edge of signal and noise. With roots in academia and eyes on real-world impact, his models don’t just predict — they adapt, learn, and survive. <br>Based in Cambridge, Dan operates from the shadows of the Hidden Layer Village — a digital alley where gradient flows meet cybernetic instinct. Whether it’s forecasting volatile markets or deploying ensemble agents into production, his code reads like a tactical dossier and hits like a plasma bolt. <br> Welcome to the neural underworld. Jack in, stay sharp, and never trust a silent model."
