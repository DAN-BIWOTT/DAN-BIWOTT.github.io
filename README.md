## About This Repository

This repository serves as a portfolio of my ongoing journey in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data science. Here, you’ll find projects ranging from predictive modeling and time-series forecasting to natural language processing and deep learning.

Each project is crafted to not only solve problems but also to deepen my understanding and share knowledge with the community.

## Featured Project: Ensemble Forecasting Model (Linear SVR + SFN)

A hybrid forecasting model combining:

- **Linear Support Vector Regressor (SVR)**  
- **Simple Feedforward Network (SFN)**  

Designed for predicting the next-period median candlestick price in the USD/JPY forex market using engineered historical features. The project highlights:

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Hyperparameter tuning with grid search  
- Ensemble learning and model evaluation  
- Exporting models to ONNX for broader deployment  
- Optional integration with remote logging API

Check out the full implementation and documentation in the [`ensembled_svr_sfn.py`](./ensembled_svr_sfn.py) file and accompanying blog posts.
