👋 Hi, I'm **Dan Kibiwott**, a computer science researcher and machine learning developer. This blog is where I document my experiments, projects, and ideas — with a strong focus on:

- Machine Learning & Forecasting Models
- Ensemble Methods (SVR, MLP, and beyond)
- Python pipelines and automation
- Real-world applications like forex prediction

### 🕸️ Why this blog?

I believe in building publicly — both to improve my craft and to contribute back to the ML community. I publish:
- Deep dives into ML model choices and data strategies
- Lessons from building trading tools
- Code walkthroughs and reproducible examples
